# -Android-AR
An Android AR application that allows users to select drills and place virtual drill markers on detected ground planes using ARCore.
# AR Drill Master ‚Äì AR Placement App for Android
 A minimal Android AR application where users can select a drill from a UI dropdown and place a virtual 3D object (cube or cone) on a real-world horizontal surface using ARCore.

---

## Project Objective

The app demonstrates a basic **Augmented Reality drill placement feature** for Android devices.  
It allows the user to:

- Select a drill from a list.
- Start the AR view.
- Tap on a real-world surface (like a floor) to place a virtual marker representing the selected drill.

>  This video shows how users can select drills and place them on real-world surfaces using AR technology on Android devices.


## Core Features

### 1. Drill Selector UI

- A user interface screen with a dropdown or list of mock drills (Drill 1, Drill 2, Drill 3).
- Each drill has a detailed page showing:
  - Image (static dummy or placeholder)
  - Description and tips
  - A button to **Start AR Drill**

### 2. AR View

- Opens the phone camera with ARCore integration.
- Detects horizontal planes (like a ground/floor).
- On user tap, places a 3D object (cube or cone) on that location.
- One object can be placed at a time (optional constraint).

Or download the ZIP and extract it.

- Open in Android Studio

## Open Android Studio.

1. Go to File > Open and select the project folder.
Sync Gradle
Let Gradle sync and download dependencies.

2. Install any missing SDKs or ARCore packages if prompted.
Connect Android Device
Enable USB Debugging on your device.
Plug in via USB and allow permissions.

3. Run the App
Click the green ‚ñ∂ ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button.
Choose your connected device.
App will build and launch on your phone.

## How to Use
- Select a drill from the dropdown on the main screen.
- Tap ‚ÄúStart AR Drill‚Äù to launch the camera.
- Point at a floor or flat surface.

## Project Status

| Phase             | Status         |
|------------------|----------------|
| Drill Selection UI |Complete     |
| ARCore Integration | Working      |
| 3D Object Placement | Cube (static), expandable |
| UI Polish & UX    | In Progress  |
| Sceneform 3D Models | Yet to implement |

## Future Work

- Replace placeholder shapes with custom 3D drill models (GLTF, OBJ, or .sfb)
- Enable multiple markers placement and persistence across sessions
- Add drill-specific analytics (e.g., count taps, placement accuracy)
- Polish UI with animations and smoother transitions
