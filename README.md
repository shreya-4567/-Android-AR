# AR Drill Master ‚Äì AR Placement App for Android

üì± A minimal Android AR application where users can select a drill from a UI dropdown and place a virtual 3D object (cube or cone) on a real-world horizontal surface using ARCore.

## üéØ Project Objective

The app demonstrates a basic **Augmented Reality drill placement feature** for Android devices.  
It allows the user to:

- Select a drill from a list.
- Start the AR view.
- Tap on a real-world surface (like a floor) to place a virtual marker representing the selected drill.

- Each drill has a detailed page showing:
  - Image (static dummy or placeholder)
  - Description and tips
  - A button to **Start AR Drill**

### 2. AR View

- Opens the phone camera with ARCore integration.
- Detects horizontal planes (like a ground/floor).
